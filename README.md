# Perseus demo authentication api

Emulates authentication endpoints for the Perseus demo. These endpoints in production will be provided by an energy provider's authentication platform. Api documentation is available at https://perseus-demo-authentication.ib1.org/api-docs.

The authentication api is responsible for authenticating and identifying its own users, and for handling and passing on requests from the client API to the FAPI API.

## Run the dev server

```bash
pipenv install --dev
pipenv run uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

## Running the local docker environment

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The docker environment uses nginx to proxy requests to uvicorn, with nginx configuration to pass through client certificates to the backend, using the same header as used by AWS ALB (`x-amzn-mtls-clientcert`). It requires a set of certificates as generated by [scripts/certmaker.sh], which should be available in the `certs` directory.
