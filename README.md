# Perseus demo energy provider

Emulates authentication and resource api endpoints for the Perseus demo.

## Authentication API

The authentication app is in the [authentication](authentication) directory. It provides endpoints for authenticating and identifying users, and for handling and passing on requests from the client API to the FAPI API.

Authentication API documentation is available at https://perseus-demo-authentication.ib1.org/api-docs.

## Resource API

The resource api is in the [resource](resource) directory. It demonstrates how to protect an API endpoint using a certificate bound token obtained from the authentication API's interaction with the FAPI provider.

Resource API documentation is available at https://perseus-demo-energy.ib1.org/api-docs.

## Running a dev server

```bash
cd authentication|resource
pipenv install --dev
pipenv run uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

## Running the local docker environment

The included docker compose file will bring up both APIs. It uses nginx to proxy requests to uvicorn, with nginx configuration to pass through client certificates to the backend, using the same header as used by AWS ALB (`x-amzn-mtls-clientcert`). It requires a set of certificates as generated by [scripts/certmaker.sh], which should be available in the `certs` directory

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The environment variables in the docker compose file point to the FAPI api running on localhost port 8020 (http://host.docker.internal:8020). As the FAPI api is not running in the docker environment, you may need to change these environment variables to match your local environment. It will also work with the live FAPI api by changing these values to "https://perseus-demo-fapi.ib1.org".

## Testing the API with client.py

client.py will execute a series of requests to the API demonstrating the steps from initial PAR (pushed authorization request) to introspecting the token presented to the resource API. The steps are

- Create a push authorization request, and store the ticket value
- Authenticate the user
- Ask for user's consent
- With the users identity and the ticket, retrieve the authorization code
- Exchange the authorization code for an access token
- Introspect the access token

```bash
pipenv run python -W ignore  client.py
```

The `-W ignore` switch suppresses multiple warnings about the self-signed certificates.

By default the client will use the local docker environment, testing against the live API can be achieved by setting the `AUTHENTICATION_API` and `RESOURCE_API` environment variables.

```bash
AUTHENTICATION_API="https://perseus-demo-authentication.ib1.org" pipenv run python -W ignore  client.py
```

A successful run will complete with outputting the token introspection response:

```bash
$ AUTHENTICATION_API="https://perseus-demo-authentication.ib1.org" pipenv run python -W ignore  client.py
Loading .env environment variables...
Courtesy Notice: Pipenv found itself running within a virtual environment, so it will automatically use that environment, instead of creating its own for any project. You can set PIPENV_IGNORE_VIRTUALENVS=1 to force pipenv to ignore that environment and create its own instead. You can set PIPENV_VERBOSITY=-1 to suppress this warning.
